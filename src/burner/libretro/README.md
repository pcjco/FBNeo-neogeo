# FBNeo-libretro

## How to build

From the root of the repository, run `make -j5 -C src/burner/libretro`

## Roms

Use clrmamepro (which runs fine on linux with wine and on mac with crossover) to build valid romsets with dats from the [dats](/dats/) directory.
Don't report issues if you didn't build a valid romset.
Also, i don't provide a "parent-only" dat file, because i don't recommend using only parent roms (some don't work, and some clones are really different from their parent)

## Emulating consoles

You can emulate consoles (with specific romsets, dats are also in the [dats](/dats/) directory) by prefixing the name of the roms with `XXX_` and removing the `zip|7z` extension, or using the `--subsystem XXX` argument in the command line, here is the list of available prefixes :
* CBS ColecoVision : `cv`
* Fairchild ChannelF : `chf`
* MSX 1 : `msx`
* Nec PC-Engine : `pce`
* Nec SuperGrafX : `sgx`
* Nec TurboGrafx-16 : `tg`
* Nintendo Entertainment System : `nes`
* Nintendo Family Disk System : `fds`
* Sega GameGear : `gg`
* Sega Master System : `sms`
* Sega Megadrive : `md`
* Sega SG-1000 : `sg1k`
* SNK Neo-Geo Pocket : `ngp`
* ZX Spectrum : `spec`

It's also possible to use folder's name for detection (this second method was added because some devices aren't compatible with subsystems) :
* CBS ColecoVision : `coleco` | `colecovision`
* Fairchild ChannelF : `chf` | `channelf`
* MSX 1 : `msx` | `msx1`
* Nec PC-Engine : `pce` | `pcengine`
* Nec SuperGrafX : `sgx` | `supergrafx`
* Nec TurboGrafx-16 : `tg16`
* Nintendo Entertainment System : `nes`
* Nintendo Family Disk System : `fds`
* Sega GameGear : `gamegear`
* Sega Master System : `sms` | `mastersystem`
* Sega Megadrive : `megadriv` | `megadrive` | `genesis`
* Sega SG-1000 : `sg1000`
* SNK Neo-Geo Pocket : `ngp`
* ZX Spectrum : `spectrum` | `zxspectrum`

## Samples

Samples should be put under `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/samples`

## Mapping

We don't have a convenient tool like the MAME OSD, instead we use the retroarch api to customize mappings, you can do that by going into `Quick menu > Controls`.
For those who don't want to fully customize their mapping, there are 2 convenient presets you can apply by changing the "device type" for a player in this menu :
* **Classic** : it will apply the original neogeo layout from neogeo cd gamepads for neogeo games, and use L/R as 5th and 6th button for 6 buttons games like Street Fighter II.
* **Modern** : it will apply the modern neogeo layout from neogeo arcade stick pro and mini pad for neogeo games, and use R1/R2 as 5th and 6th button for 6 buttons games like Street Fighter II (because it's also their modern layout), this is really convenient with most arcade sticks.

The following "device type" also exist, but they won't be compatible with every games :
* **Mouse (ball only)** : it will use mouse/trackball for analog movements, buttons will stay on retropad
* **Mouse (full)** : same as above, but the buttons will be on the mouse
* **Pointer** : it will use "pointer" device (can be a mouse/trackball) to determine coordinates on screen, buttons will stay on retropad
* **Lightgun** : it will use lightgun to determine coordinates on screen, buttons will be on the lightgun too.

## Frequently asked questions

### Where can i find the XXX roms ?
As far as we are concerned, you are supposed to dump your own games, so we can't help you with acquiring romsets.

### Game XXX is not launching, why ?
It is either not supported or you have a bad rom, your logs will give you more details. Build a valid romset with clrmamepro as said above.
There is also a few games marked as not working, try one of their clones.

### I patched game XXX and can't run it, why ?
Because it's considered a bad rom since the crcs won't match, however there is a method to use a patched romset, if you put the patched version of the romset into `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/patched` it will work (NB: you can strip it of any file that don't differ from non-patched romset if you want)

### Game XXX has graphical glitches, why ?
Write a report with details on the issue and your platform.

### Game XXX runs slowly, why ?
Your hardware is probably too slow to run the game with normal settings. Try the following :
* Check if there is a speedhack dipswitch in the core options, set it to "yes".
* Try setting a value for frameskip in core options.
* Try lowering CPU clock in core options
* Try disabling rewind, runahead, or any other retroarch setting known for increasing overhead.
* Try lowering audio settings in the core options.
* If it is not enough, upgrade/overclock your hardware, or use another core.

We won't accept requests for "making the core faster", as far as we are concerned this core has a good balance between accuracy & speed, and for the most part will already run really well on cheap arm socs (rpi3, ...).

### Game XXX has choppy sound, why ?
Most likely for the same reason as above.

### Game XXX runs faster in MAME2003/MAME2010, why ?
Overall, FBNeo is slower than old MAME version because it's more accurate (meaning less bugs).
This libretro port also support various features which are usually buggy or absent in MAME cores (runahead, netplay, rewind, retroachievements, ...). It might use additional resources.

### How do i use cheat code ?
From a libretro point of view, there should be partial support through the API relying on main ram exposition. 
Otherwise if you put native FBNeo cheat .ini files (there is a pack available [here](https://github.com/finalburnneo/FBNeo-cheats/archive/master.zip)) into `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/cheats`, they will be translated to core options, using a MAME `cheat.dat` file should also work.

### Neogeo CD doesn't work, why ?
There are several things to know :
* You need a copy of neocdz.zip and neogeo.zip in your libretro system directory
* You need to add `--subsystem neocd` to the command line, or to place your games in a `neocd` folder
* Supported format are ccd/sub/img (trurip), and single file MODE1/2352 cue/bin (use utilities like "CDmage" to convert your iso if needed), **they must not be compressed**

You can convert your unsupported isos by following this tutorial :
* Get [CDMage 1.02.1 (beta)](https://www.videohelp.com/software/CDMage) (freeware & no ads). **Don't get CDMage 1.01.5, it doesn't have the "Save As" function**
* File > Open > select your iso (NB : for multi-track, select the .cue file, not the .iso file)
* File > Save As > write the name of your new file
* Make sure you select MODE1/2352 in the second drop-down
* Press OK, wait for the process to finish (a few seconds on my computer), and itâ€™s done !

### Killer instinct won't work, why ?
That driver was disabled for now, it doesn't meet our quality criteria.

~~There are several things to know :~~
* ~~It is only running at playable speed on x86_64 (other arch will basically need a cpu at 4Ghz because they lack a mips3 dynarec), and the core needs to be built like this to enable this dynarec : `make -j5 -C src/burner/libretro USE_X64_DRC=1`~~
* ~~If your rom is at `ROM_DIRECTORY/kinst.zip`, you'll need the uncompressed disc image at `ROM_DIRECTORY/kinst/kinst.img`~~
* ~~To get the uncompressed disc image, you'll need to use the chdman tool from MAME on the chd from mame, the command looks like this : `chdman extracthd -i kinst.chd -o kinst.img`~~

### Hiscore won't save, why ?
You need to copy [hiscore.dat](/metadata/hiscore.dat) to `SYSTEM_DIRECTORY/fbneo/` and to have the hiscore core option enabled. It doesn't guarantee hiscores will work for a specific game though, sometimes a driver could just be missing the necessary support code for hiscores (or hiscore.dat might not be listing the romset). You can request support in the issue tracker as long as the request is reasonable (avoid making a list of several dozens/hundreds of games if you don't want to be ignored). There are also some cases where libretro features will prevent hiscores from working properly, runahead is a well-known case but there might be other savestates-related features causing issues.

### On my android device, game XXX is closing my app at launch, why ?
Android OS has one of the worst features ever created : it kills an app if it considers it's not responding fast enough, no question asked ! Furthermore the criteria to decide it's not fast enough is different from a device to another. That's called ANR and that's something you can supposedly workaround by enabling some option about ANR (Application Not Responding) inside Android's hidden developper menu. Some people also reported that those ANR issues would disappear after changing from a controller to another, or after switching from a version of retroarch to another. Some games like `kof2003`, `svc` and `mslug5` are known for being affected by this issue on some android devices, and we can't do anything about it since it's not an internal program error.
